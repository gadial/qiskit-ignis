        Reconstruct a gate set from measurement data using linear inversion.

        Returns:
            A list of tuples (G, label) of gate representation
            and this gate's label as given in gateset_basis

        Additional Information:
            Given a gate set (G1,...,Gm)
            and SPAM circuits (F1,...,Fn) constructed from those gates
            the data should contain the probabilities of the following types:
            p_ijk = E*F_i*G_k*F_j*rho
            p_ij = E*F_i*F_j*rho

            One constructs the Gram matrix g = (p_ij)_ij
            which can be described as a product g=AB
            where A = sum (i> <E F_i) and B=sum (F_j rho><j)
            For each gate Gk one can also construct the matrix Mk=(pijk)_ij
            which can be described as Mk=A*Gk*B
            Inverting g we obtain g^-1 = B^-1A^-1 and so
            g^1 * Mk = B^-1 * Gk * B
            This gives us a matrix similiar to Gk's representing matrix.
            However, it will not be the same as Gk,
            since the observable results cannot distinguish
            between (G1,...,Gm) and (B^-1*G1*B,...,B^-1*Gm*B)
            a further step of *Gauge optimization* is required on the results
            of the linear inversion stage.
            One can also use the linear inversion results as a starting point
            for a MLE optimization for finding a physical gateset, since
            unless the probabilities are accurate, the resulting gateset
            need not be physical.
